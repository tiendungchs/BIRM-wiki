# Design It Twice

When the user wants to explore alternative interfaces for a chosen deepening candidate, use this parallel sub-agent pattern. Based on "Design It Twice" (Ousterhout): your first idea is unlikely to be the best.

Uses the vocabulary in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md): **module**, **interface**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**.

**Gate.** Step 2 spawns parallel sub-agents. In a project whose instructions forbid delegating without an explicit request — this one does, see `CLAUDE.md` — run it only when the user has asked for it in this session. Otherwise do the same passes **serially in one agent**: produce each design in full under its own constraint before starting the next, and do not let a later design read as a patch on an earlier one. The point is radically different interfaces, and serial work makes that harder, not impossible.

## Process

### 1. Frame the problem space

Before spawning sub-agents, write a user-facing explanation of the problem space for the chosen candidate:

- The constraints any new interface would need to satisfy
- The dependencies it would rely on, and which category they fall into (see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md))
- A rough illustrative sketch to ground the constraints — code, or for a learned module a block-and-wire diagram naming what crosses each seam and what is denied across it. Not a proposal, just a way to make the constraints concrete

Show this to the user, then immediately proceed to Step 2. The user reads and thinks while the sub-agents work in parallel.

### 2. Spawn sub-agents

Spawn 3+ sub-agents in parallel. Each must produce a **radically different** interface for the deepened module.

Prompt each sub-agent with a separate technical brief (file paths, coupling details, dependency category from [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md), what sits behind the seam). The brief is independent of the user-facing problem-space explanation in Step 1. Give each agent a different design constraint:

- Agent 1: "Minimize the interface: aim for 1–3 entry points max. Maximise leverage per entry point."
- Agent 2: "Maximise flexibility: support many use cases and extension."
- Agent 3: "Optimise for the most common caller: make the default case trivial."
- Agent 4 (if applicable): "Design around ports & adapters for cross-seam dependencies."

Include both [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) vocabulary and the **project's domain vocabulary** in the brief, so each design names things consistently with the architecture language and the project's own language. The domain vocabulary lives wherever this project keeps it: a `CONTEXT.md` if one exists, otherwise the project instructions (`CLAUDE.md`), `wiki/glossary.md`, and the registry rows the candidate touches. Do not cite `CONTEXT.md` in a repo that has none.

Each sub-agent outputs:

1. Interface (types, methods, params, plus invariants, ordering, error modes)
2. Usage example showing how callers use it
3. What the implementation hides behind the seam
4. Dependency strategy and seam adapters — classify on the taxonomy that fits (authored code, or the gradient axis for learned modules; see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md))
5. Trade-offs: where leverage is high, where it's thin

### 3. Present and compare

Present designs sequentially so the user can absorb each one, then compare them in prose. Contrast by **depth** (leverage at the interface), **locality** (where change concentrates), and **seam placement**.

After comparing, give your own recommendation: which design you think is strongest and why. If elements from different designs would combine well, propose a hybrid. Be opinionated: the user wants a strong read, not a menu.
